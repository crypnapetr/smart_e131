# smart_e131
Arduino sketch to support both E1.31 and Smart Home for Relay Shield

I created this so that I could control my AC/USB devices... smoke machine, lasers, misc. homemade props with both xlights and via my phone (blynk).  Future enhancements should include local control w/o reliance on cloud for smart function. I am currently running this on Wemo D1 mini w/ relay shield.

(lights are controlled via WLED loaded on Nano)
